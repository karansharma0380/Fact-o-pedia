# fact-o-pedia

### This a one stop website where you can share and post unseen & astonishing facts!

- Created an end to end full stack application using `NodeJS` at the backend. 
- The database is used to store authentication data as well as content is `MongoDB`.
- Used `GraphQL` query language for implementing backend APIs and managed using `Apollo`.
- APIs are connected to the `ReactJS` front-end application.

## Some Important Functionalities
- Each user needs to register/login an account beforw creating any post on the website, however he can view the posts without logging in.
- Logged in users can create new posts, like other posts as well as comment on someone's posts.
- Delete functionality has also been implemented with multi-user functionality on the website.
- Some major learnings were: React Hooks and state management, GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions as well as context in React.
